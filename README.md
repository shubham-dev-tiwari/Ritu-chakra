# Ritu Chakra - The Weather App That Knows What You're Thinking! üå¶Ô∏è

Welcome to **Ritu Chakra**, the weather app that‚Äôs almost as good as your best friend who always forgets their umbrella! ‚òîÔ∏è Whether you're wondering if you need sunscreen or just a heavy coat, this app has you covered (metaphorically speaking).

## Live Demo

Check out the app and see if it predicts your weather accurately (or just has a good laugh at your expense): [Ritu Chakra - Weather App](https://ritu-chakra.vercel.app/)

## Features

- **Real-Time Weather Updates:** Because we all need a reliable excuse for our bad hair days. üå™Ô∏è
- **Responsive Design:** Looks fab whether you're on your phone, tablet, or pretending to work on your laptop.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** So simple, even your grandma can check if it‚Äôs a good day for gardening.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** The skeleton of our weather app (with none of the rain).
- **CSS:** The fancy clothes that make our app look good, no matter how stormy it is.
- **Tomorrow.io API:** The crystal ball that tells us if you should wear shorts or snow boots.

## Getting Started

Want to see if the app can predict whether you'll need to shovel snow or dodge raindrops? Here‚Äôs how you can get it running locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shubham-dev-tiwari/Ritu-chakra.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd Ritu-chakra
    ```

3. **Open the `index.html` File:**

    Simply open `index.html` in your favorite web browser and marvel at its weather-forecasting powers.

## How It Works

- The app uses the Tomorrow.io API to fetch the weather data‚Äîbecause magic doesn‚Äôt exist (yet).
- It‚Äôs responsive, so it adjusts itself to your device, whether you‚Äôre planning a beach day or a snowball fight.
